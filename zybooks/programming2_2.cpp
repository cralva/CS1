//The three programming constructs
    //1. Sequential logic: by default. 
    //2. Conditional logic (if -else can also be called a decision)
    //3. Iteration logic (loops)
    //3. nesting and stacking

    //8 bits = 1 byte (a byte is a char or character in cpp)

//we have coding systems: ASCII, unicode, ebcdic (original coding system that ibm created)

//google "ascii wiki" to see what it stands for and see some examples

//when assigning a value for a variable if we do it twice then the first one will get replaced with the newest variable
    //numChars = 5
    //numChars = 3
    //If we want an output then the 5 will get ignored and the three will be the output
